    From the Begining 
    <p>Victoira has loved to create art since a very young age. As a child she was often discouraged by her parents who pushed her to more academic pursuts.
    Victoria's sibblings remeber her always creating. Sitting in her room for hours drawing and creating art.</p>
    <p>Victoria's life has not alway been an easy one. She is a survior through and through. Suffering from breast cancer and many other tragedys. You would not
      know this when talking to Victoria however. She greets everyone with open arms, a smile on her face and joy in her heart.</p>
    <p>I was when she was first struggling with cancer and treatments that a friend gave her oil paints and a canvas that she rediscoverd her love and desire to 
      create. She went on to take summer classes at a local college working on her freehand drawing.</p>
    <p>Vicotria has traveled the United States and has left a beuatiful trail of creation behind her. She now resides in Flagstaff with her family, her son, 
      daughter-in-law and grandchildren. Her grandchildren love her artwork and she often encourages them to draw and create alongside her in their family home.</p>
    <p>While Victoria does create beautiful protriats and abstract paintings it is her unique and individual pen and ink style that makes her work so unique. 
      Like a classical piece of music you experinece the piece when you look into her line drawings. You can feel the emotions of the piece and become enveloped 
      in the scene that she creates. "I take a line for a walk. It turns into a journey of its own, to reveal the secrets and unremebered past. I always start 
      with a single line and allow it to ve continous throughout the entire experience. It reveals itself and then it is complete."-Victoria.
